                <p>I've been studying front-end development for a long time. There are a lot of different technologies that you need to remember well. To do this, it is not enough to become familiar with the technology in theory; the developer must learn to apply this technology in practice, and understand how this technology helps solve the problem. To do this, the engineer must write projects.</p>

                <p>This page contains all my projects, from the very first to now. Also, almost all projects have a link to the GitHub repository and a link to the deployed project. Enjoy watching!</p>

Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. A modal window appears with a message about who won. Statistics with victories and defeats are also kept.'

This is notes, where all users haves personally account, and they can write and save notes, delete, like, view and change them. There are also searcher of notes and filtration by title, description, date of created/changed and liked notes. Also in this project I had to write a small server and use a fake API. Therefore, there is a small problem - when rebooting, the server does not understand what route it is on and displays a 404 error. I donâ€™t know Backend development well, so I could not solve this problem.'
